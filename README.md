This is my playground to use VAE on various crazy stuff...

1. ~~Trying to use a self-contrastive training framework for VAE~~. (Fix the problem of lower bound)
2. ~~Interesting to see how VAE could improve the mutual information between z and x~~
2. Using VAE to separate relative location from content.
